# REG Open Source Service Area (OS SA)
This is the repository of the Open Source Service Area of the Research Engineering Group of the Alan Turing Institute. We work to make REG a better open source citizen by contributing and enabling and encouraging the rest of REG and Turing to contribute to the wider open source ecosystem.

All content in this repo is in the issues and the related [project board](https://github.com/orgs/alan-turing-institute/projects/156). We use them to track ideas and discuss what we could do, plan to do, are doing, and have done.

## This is a public repository

Note that this repo is _not_ Turing or REG internal, but rather fully public. We champion a culture of openness, and the vast majority of our conversations are fine for all the world to read. However, please be mindful when discussing in this repo to
* not talk about any Turing internal policies/practicies/events/discussions, or things that concern other teams that they have not consented to being made public.
* not refer to individuals who aren't on GitHub, at least not without their consent, or who might not want that reference to them being made publicly.

For any non-public information, feel free to link to Turing internal resources when necessary.
